The following should be regarded as what they are: merely "guidelines"
rather than hard-and-fast rules.


			     General Grading Guidelines
			     ==========================

The following guidelines apply to grading both homeworks and projects:

  + The grading should be as consistent as possible:

      #  For each assignment, between different students.

      #  Between different assignments, though that is less important than
         (1).

  + To help achieve consistency, it may be a good idea to hold off on
    completing grading, until the late submission deadline has passed.  Of
    course, end-of-semester and other deadlines may preclude this.

  + For what seem to be minor problems, 1/2 a point can be taken off.
    However, when the overall assignment grade is recorded it should be
    rounded up to the nearest integer.

  + The guidelines given here are not inviolate and can be violated when it
    makes sense to do so.

			Exam and Homework Grading Guidelines
			====================================

  + Not all homework/exam questions have exactly one answer; in fact, some
    homeworks questions may be vague, intentionally or sometimes
    unintentionally.  The student's answer to such questions should be
    graded against what the question (and any clarifications made to it)
    actually specifies and not only by comparison with the solution.  For
    such questions, the provided solution may be only one of many possible
    solutions.

  + It is the student's obligation to ensure that work turned in is readable
    by any average person. A TA should not feel obligated to decipher
    illegible scribblings.

  + It is the student's obligation to clearly indicate which answers are
    canceled; if there are multiple answers to the same question, then only
    the last answer will be graded.

  + A reasonable answer should get at least 50% of the maximum points for
    that question.

  + If the language or style used in an assignment is inconsistent,
    you should be suspicious.  Often web searches may be used to find
    sources which the student copied without citing them, which
    constitutes cheating.

  + If a question is marked `[RECORD]`, then the TA should record the
    grade obtained for that question individually for each student.
    

			  Project Grading Guidelines
			  ==========================	

  + A project may be submitted multiple times before the project submission
    deadline.  Only the last submission should be graded.

  + If a project does not compile, the student should usually get no more
    than 65%.  Depending on how complete the project is, it may get
    appreciably less.  In this case, it is useful to look for README or
    other files the student may have enclosed explaining the status of his
    or her project.

    If it doesn't compile because it appears to be missing a file,
    then the TA *may* attempt to contact the student by email.
    However, the TA has no obligation to do so, since it is entirely
    the student's responsibility to ensure that the submission is
    complete.

  + If a project compiles and passes all its runtime tests it should be
    guaranteed at least 85% assuming it has met *all* aspects of the project
    specification.  Note that this does not imply that a project which fails
    a single test cannot get more than 85%.

  + The remaining 15% should be a judgement call on the TA's part.
    Things like the following:

      + Quality of code.  Is it modular?  Does it exhibit cut-and-paste reuse
        rather than reuse using programming constructs?

	If a reader cannot understand the code because the code logic
        is convoluted with assignments to the same variable
        interspersed in complex control flow, then that is often an
        indication of poor code quality.

        5-10 points may be taken off for particularly egregious submissions.

      + Is it well-commented?  Note that the important point is that
        the program should be easily understandable and not that it
        meet some bureaucratic guidelines that every function have
        comments in such-and-such form.  Also note that a program
        understandable on its own with minimal or even no comments is
        preferable to a convoluted program which needs heavy
        commenting to explain its convolutions.

      + Is it over-commented?  Does it exhibit the `i++; /* increment i */`
        syndrome?

      + Consistency of formatting and naming conventions.  No
        particular style is mandated as we all have our favorites.
        The consistency though is important and IMHO a important
        indicator of how well crafted the program may be.  5-10 points
        may be taken off for particularly egregious submissions.

      + Are there unnecessary fixed limits built into the code?  Are
        there arrays declared with a fixed size which does not
        naturally follow from the problem domain?

      + Are there magic numbers hardwired into code rather than being
        referenced via symbolic names.  This is such an egregious
        violation of good programming practice that even a single
        violation can be penalized by taking off 5 points.

      + Does the project use the method(s) and algorithm(s) specified
        in the assignment.  If not, you can take off much more than
        15%, depending on how far off the project went from the spirit
        of the assignment.

  + The TA should usually merely be glancing at the code.  If a test case
    has failed, then an attempt may be made to try finding out what caused
    it to fail, but usually it would be unreasonable to spend more than a
    couple of minutes on it.

A graded project should be returned to the students either
electronically.  The returned material should contain at least the
following:

  a) The overall grade (and breakup if applicable).

  b) A copy of the student's README file.

  c) Log of the compilation (if applicable).

  d) Some description of the test case(s) used along with inputs and 
     expected outputs.

  e) Log of the program execution.

Additionally it may also contain listings of portions of the students
programs with the TA's comments added.

	      	       Returning Graded Work
		       =====================

Graded work should be returned to students, usually within 2 weeks
after the late submission deadline, either via brightspaceor github.
Besides the points obtained, the graded work should also include
indications of why points were lost.  This can be via annotations or a
separate text file.


	      	        Recording Grades
			================

Before assignments are returned to the student, the TA should
record those grades electronically.  Since *mycourses* is not capable
of performing the computations needed for determining the overall
grade, please use Google Sheets to maintain the master copy of the
grades for the class.  After the master copy has been updated, the
changes can be uploaded over to *mycourses* so that they can be
accessed by students.

It is important to ensure that the spreadsheet distinguishes between
assignments which were not turned in and those for which a zero grade
was obtained.  The former should not be used in computing course
statistics whereas the latter should be used.

There should be a master sheet which contains all grades for the
entire class.  The use of other sheets is entirely up to you; if there
are multiple TAs associated with the course, you may choose to have
each TA enter their grades on their own sheets with a systematic
procedure set up to copy them into the master sheet.

The master sheet should contain a column containing the overall grade
for each student based on the assigned weights mentioned in the
syllabus, except that it should not drop any grades.  This provides a
snapshot of a student's performance as the course progresses.

      	       		Accreditation Requirements
			==========================

For accreditation purposes, it is necessary to track the work done by
students.  Specifically, if a question on a homework or exam is
marked `[RECORD]`, then the TA should record the grade obtained for that
question individually for each student.


       	      	  	 Assignment of Final Grades
			 ==========================

Letter grades will be assigned strictly monotonically based on the overall
grades with major input from the TA(s).  If at all possible, students whose
overall grades differ by a very tiny amount will receive the same letter
grade.

Assignment of final grades will be done during a meeting after all
work has been graded.  For this meeting, the TA should provide a tab
containing a summary of all the class grades (details of grades for
individual assignments can be on other tabs).  Headings on the summary
tab should be fixed so that they are always visible as the content of
the tab are scrolled.  This should also be done for rows with
aggregates so that grades can be sorted without moving the aggregates.

This tab should contain the following columns:

  # A single column for the student name titled `Student Name`.  Each
    entry should be of the form "Last"`,` "First".

  # A single column for the students B-number titled `B-Number`.

  # A single column for the grade for each project assigned titled
    `prj`"N" for "N" in 1, 2...

  # A single column the grade for for each homework assigned titled
    `hw`"N" for "N" in 1, 2...

  # A single column for the grade for each quiz assigned `qz`"N" for
    "N" in 1, 2...

  # A single column for each exam titled `exam1`, `exam2` and `exam3`.

  # A single column for the overall project grade out of 100, titled
    `PrjAvg` with lowest project dropped as per the course grading
    policy.

  # A single column for the overall homework grade out of 100, titled
    `HwAvg` with lowest homework dropped as per the course grading
    policy.

  # A single column for the overall quiz grade out of 100, titled
    `QzAvg` with lowest quiz dropped as per the course grading
    policy.

  # A single column for the overall exam grade out of 100, titled
    `ExAvg` with lowest exam dropped as per the course grading
    policy.

  # A single column for the overall course grade out of 100 titled
    `Total` weighted as per the weights specified in the course
    grading policy.

  # A single column for the assigned letter grade titled `Grade`.
    This column will be completed during the meeting.

  # During the meeting, the cutoffs used will be recorded in the
    spreadsheet, possibly on a separate tab.

There should be a row for each student with the rows set up in
alternating colors so that they are easy to scan.  These rows should
be sorted in descending order by the `Total` column.

Additionally, there should be rows giving the aggregates for each
individual column:

  # Number submitted titled `Number`.  

  # Maximum grade titled `Max`.

  # Average grade titled `Average`.  This should not count students who
    did not submit.

  # Minimum grade titled `Min`. This should not count students who
    did not submit.

A printout should be provided before the meeting of this tab in
landscape mode with the fonts and column widths adjusted so that all
columns fit within a single sheet.  If that is impossible and students
can be uniquely identified by their names, drop the B-number column.
